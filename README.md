# Pytorch implementation of Hierarchial Clustering-based Pooling for Graph Learning

A novel method called HiCAP (Hierarchical Cluster-Based Attention Pooling) is proposed to address the limitations of existing graph pooling approaches.

## Requirements

    * Python >= 3.6
    * Pytorch >= 2.0.1+cu118
    * Pytorch_geometric >= 2.4.0
    * Numpy
    * Networkx

## Usage

```Python
python3 main.py
```
In case of using CUDA:
```python
CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1 python3 main.py
```
NOTE: there are various arguments which you can modify, please see ```main.py``` for further details.
